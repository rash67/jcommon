package com.samrash.stats;

/**
 * This was written to resemble some older libraries.  You may find
 * more functionality in StatsUtil.java.
 *
 * This is the interface that mirrors
 * fbcode/common/fb303/cpp/FacebookBase.h functionality for adding
 * stats that track their history over 60 secs, 600 secs, 3600 secs,
 * and "alltime".  Any class that implements HistoryMgrIf will
 * implement FacebookServiceIf (see thrift files) as well.
 *
 * HistoryMgrIf manages a set of stats.  Stats are usually registered
 * with a call to addStatExportType(name,etype) and then set or
 * incremented many times with addStatValue(name,delta).  The export
 * type supports reporting different summaries of the stat (sum, avg,
 * rate, count).
 *
 * For example, an event counter can be exported with "sum" and "avg"
 * and if it's incremented once a second with addStatValue("c", 10)
 * the getCounters() call will report "c.sum.60 == 600", "c.avg.60 ==
 * 10", "c.sum.600 = 6000", etc.  (Assuming the underlying
 * implementation uses a MultiWindowRate counter which reports stats
 * histories for 60, 600, 3600, and "alltime".)
