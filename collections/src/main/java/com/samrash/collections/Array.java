 * The idea here is to provide a uniform interface for arrays so that we may
 * implement data structures on top of them seeming to use "Objects", with auto[un]boxing,
 * but the backing storage may be primitive arrays in order to save memory
 * (ex: hash tables implemented in terms of arrays)
 *
 * While this interface doesn't 100% enforce that implementations will be a class array,
 * the implementation should have array-like properties in terms of memory usage and time
 * of operations:  get/setshould be O(1).  resize should be O(n).  append() should be O(1)
 * amortized with set() calls in that it's basically an iterator walking towards the end, and will
 * insert values in the first empty slot. A slot at it's ptr is not empty only if set was called,
 * so you can see the # of total set/append calls to fill a list is O(N), 2N in the pathological
 * case (call set on all values and leave the last empty; append will take O(N) time and then
 * the array is full
 *
 * @param <T> type of the array. T = Long may in fact mean the backing storage
 * could be long[] which saves 24 bytes per entry (the pointer + 2w overhead)
 *
 * Each implementation defines if it's thread safe or not
