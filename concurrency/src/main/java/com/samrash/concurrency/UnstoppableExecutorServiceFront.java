/**
 * combines the functionality of an ExecutorServiceFront and

 * another. You bound the number of 'virtual threads' (Drainers) and
 * optionally a max time slice each Drainer may use. This is approximate
 * as a Drainer does not interrupt tasks running--it only checks between
 * tasks to see if the maxTimeSlice is reached and then gives up the
 * underlying thread in the delegate executor
